Create unencrypted private key and CSR with a single command:
-openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout cert.key -out cert.csr


Create a Self-Signed Certificate
    A self-signed certificate is a certificate that's
    signed with its own private key. It can be used to
    encrypt data just as well as CA-signed certificates,
    but our users will be shown a warning that says the certificate isn't trusted.
-openssl req -key cert.key -new -x509 -days 365 -out cert.crt


Create a Certificate authority by creating self-signed rootCA cert
-openssl req -x509 -sha256 -days 1825 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout rootCA.key -out rootCA.crt

Create new txt file (root.ext) with this code in it:
            authorityKeyIdentifier=keyid,issuer
            basicConstraints=CA:FALSE
            subjectAltName = @twitter
            [twitter]
            DNS.1 = localhost

-openssl x509 -req -CA rootCA.crt -CAkey rootCA.key -in
 cert.csr -out cert.crt -days 365 -CAcreateserial -extfile root. ext

Create unencrypted private key and CSR with a single command:
-openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout cert.key -out cert.csr


Create a Self-Signed Certificate
    A self-signed certificate is a certificate that's
    signed with its own private key. It can be used to
    encrypt data just as well as CA-signed certificates,
    but our users will be shown a warning that says the certificate isn't trusted.
-openssl req -key cert.key -new -x509 -days 365 -out cert.crt
